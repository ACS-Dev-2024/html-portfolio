<h2>These are some of my go-to movies, guaranteed for a good laugh.</h2>

<h3>Clue</h3>
<p>
Jonathan Lynn's 1985 cult-comedy ensemble romp, based on the classic board game to figure out "who dunnit?!"
Emcee'd by the inimitable Tim Curry as the butler "Wadsworth", Clue delivers stage-like laughs set against a backdrop of campy Cold War humor.
Think Blazing Saddles meets Dr. Strangelove.

<h3>Airheads</h3>
<p>
Three dimwitted wannabe rockstars hold a radio station hostage with one demand... dude, just play our record.
Helmed by Brendan Fraser, Adam Sandler, and Steve Buscemi, 1994's Airheads is an oft-overlooked quintessential 90's classic.
For the rock music fans, keep your eyes peeled for a few notable cameos, including Motorhead's own Lemmy Kilmeister.

<h3>Stripes</h3>
<p>
Move aside Ghostbusters, because this is truly the peak Bill Murray classic. 
1981's Stripes sees rudderless Chicago buddies Bill Murray and Harold Ramis enlist in the Army to "be all that they can be," which turns out isn't much.
However, supported by a cast of comedy legends including John Candy, Stripes gives our leads the chance to be real heroes when duty calls.
Stripes doesn't deliver warzone grit, only side-splitting laughs.
